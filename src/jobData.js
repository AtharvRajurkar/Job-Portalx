      'Nice to meet you!\n\nWe’re a leader in data and AI. Through our software and services, we inspire customers around the world to transform data into intelligence – and questions into answers.We’re also a debt-free multi-billion-dollar organization on our path to IPO-readiness. If you’re looking for a dynamic, fulfilling career coupled with flexibility and world-class employee experience, you’ll find it here.\n\nAbout the job\n\nWe are looking for passionate, driven, and team-oriented software developers to help push existing and emerging SAS analytics to new heights and frontiers in terms of performance and quality. We are a small passionate team that, at our heart, live for fast-paced problem-solving in any domain but are centered in SAS\'s advanced analytics division. Granted the freedom to move horizontally across the analytics domain, we work closely with diverse analytic teams, always learning and growing. What makes our team unique is our ability to wear multiple genre hats at the same time. In a sense, we are "tri-lingual," conversant, and comfortable working side-by-side with experts in hardware, software, and analytics simultaneously. This helps us partner with different analytics teams, applying an array of modern performance monitoring tools to better understand and find computational and performance bottlenecks.\n\nWorking directly with the analytic routines authors and/or owners, we can quickly learn the underlying mathematics for targeted regions of the algorithm. As a team, we next do deep internal and external searches to better understand what is happening with respect to the targeted hardware device as well as understand existing "work-arounds" used in the community. We then rapidly prototype and stress test new analytic sub-routines that can mitigate, if not eliminate, targeted performance issues, freeing partner teams to work at a higher level. We often work in the murky gap between compilers\' current intelligence and the developer\'s true intention. The scope of what we do can vary on the needs of SAS, sometimes strategically touching only a few key subroutines/lines of code while at other times creating the entire analytic routine itself. Because we must move quickly horizontally across SAS analytic teams, we seek to minimize the legacy code we own ourselves, passing off encoded solutions to other teams who are more vertically oriented. Thus, we strongly adhere to the maxim "fall in love with the problem, not any one solution, including your own."\n\nWe are a small team, and each member comes with a unique critical skill set. For what we do to work, team members must place the needs of the team over the individual, building a culture of trust and respect. Because we often work on other people\'s software and code, the ability to project a sense of psychological safety is key. We are here to help and not to judge. In terms of the "big 5" personality traits, we thus seek individuals who are high in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness. We have found that these combinations of psychological traits create an environment where rapid-pace hive-mind-like solutions to hard problems are created in near real-time.\n\n \n\nAs a Senior Software Developer, you will:\n• Work closely with diverse analytics teams at SAS\n• Serve as tip of the spear on important proof of concept projects involving new technologies with an initial focus on quantum computing\n• Tackle challenging problems that many feel are unsolvable or claim have been attempted before without success\n• Think outside of the box when solving problems, looking for ways to "slice" rather than "untie" the proverbial Gordian knot.\n• Develop high-speed analytic sub-routines.\n• Become intimately familiar with available profiling and memory monitoring tools in a distributed, threaded, and hybrid computing world.\n• Work on revising and/or implementing QPU adaptive hybrid algorithms in a distributed environment.\n• Quickly come to speed on target elements of diverse analytical routines in terms of underlying mathematics, code realization, and corresponding underlying execution on hardware.\n• Present, publish, and patent whenever possible and beneficial to SAS\n• Work on improving quantum algorithms related to machine learning, statistics, and optimization.\n• Collaborate with other analytic teams to help build and transform quantum research projects or ideas into production-level product features.\n• Ensures all applicable security policies and processes are followed to support the organization\'s secure software development goals.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n• Bachelor\'s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Operations Research or a related discipline\n• 8+ years of software development experience\n• Strong computer programming skills with excellent analytical and problem-solving skills\n• Deep understanding of linear algebra in relation to analytics\n• Experience writing performant analytics routines in Python\n• Experience developing with one or more quantum computing vendors such as qiskit\n• Experience with quantum machine learning\n• Experience in quantum circuit design\n• Experience with quantum optimization\n• Background in popular machine learning optimization algorithms\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Understanding of popular quantum vendors and SDKs\n• Knowledge and experience in Quantum Computing with an emphasis on optimization algorithms\n• Experience with automated performance benchmarking strategies\n• A high-level understanding of most machine learning algorithms with a deep knowledge of a few\n• Background in logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, gradient boosting, random forest, PCA, etc.\n• Background in mixed-integer optimization\n• Background in large-scale nonlinear optimization\n• Understanding of derivative-free optimization algorithms, strengths and limitations\n\nWorld-class benefits\n\nHighlights include...\n\n• Comprehensive medical, prescription, dental and vision plans. • Medical plan options include…• PPO with low annual deductible and copays. • HDHP combined with a health savings account with a contribution from SAS (no access to on-site health care center). • Onsite Health Care Center (HQ) that’s free to employees and family members enrolled in the PPO plan.

      "Job Description Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA) delivers a complete AI platform to create conversational experiences for business applications through text, chat, and voice interfaces. ODA is a platform for creating conversational interfaces or chatbots. A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation (written or spoken), allowing humans to interact with applications and data as if they were communicating with a real person. The world is seeing a global shift toward AI in the healthcare industry and ODA is delivering AI-driven solutions in the Oracle Health & Artificial Intelligence (OHAI) space. Part of this stems from the healthcare industry’s transition towards a cloud environment for data management; with the cloud, data is now available on a real-time scale for further analysis. But rather than rely on staff to meticulously comb through data, artificial intelligence enables a much efficient—and in many cases, much more accurate—process. OHAI and ODA core values are how we deliver excellence. We strive for equity, inclusion, and respect for all. We are committed to the greater good in our products and our actions. We are constantly learning and taking opportunities to grow our careers and ourselves. We challenge each other to stretch beyond our past to build our future. As a Frontend Engineer, you will work with teams of software engineers responsible for the software design, development, and operations for our new and existing products. You should be able to translate UX designs into a workable implementation, be hands-on, and be able to dive deep into any part of the UI stack. You should value simplicity and impact, work comfortably in a collaborative, agile environment, and be excited to learn.
